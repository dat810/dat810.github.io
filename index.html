	<p>I am just a casual guy who likes computers. I am enthusiastic about programming languages like Java and Python. Besides that, I am also interested in website development and data visualizations. Currently, I am focusing on front-end development. I would like to share my work with you.</p>

	</section>
	<button class="accordion" onclick="toggleAcc()">How many languages can you speak?</button>
	<section class="accordion-txt">
		<p>Two. Since I am from China, I can speak Chinese. I also speak English because I am planning to study abroad in the US (which may not be possible due to COVID-19).</p>
	</section>
	<button class="accordion" onclick="toggleAcc()">Why the name "Datario"?</button>
	<section class="accordion-txt">
		<p>It's because I like data visualizations (such as bar chart races and line graphs) and I wanted a username that emphasizes that I make data visualizations. I chose "Datario" for no reason at all because it just came out of my mind and it was not taken. <br><i>Note: I was later shocked when I tried to make a GitHub account because "Datario" was taken there! So it became "datario-viz" instead.</i></p>
	</section>
	<button class="accordion" onclick="toggleAcc()">Why did you start doing such things? </button>
	<section class="accordion-txt">
		<p>It's because of inspiration. Long time ago in November 2018, I encountered data visualization videos on YouTube. They were uploaded by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy0dKy89rZFR8OCbAT69wcQ" target="_blank" title="Click to see WawamuStats's YouTube Channel">WawamuStats</a>. I wondered how these videos even made, but I had no clue. So I kept watching these, and they are getting more attractive over time, with more views. Later I also discovered a channel named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/1abacaba1" target="_blank" title="Click to see Abacaba's YouTube Channel">Abacaba</a> (owned by carykh, co-creator of BFDI). That channel has very creative visualizing methods, not only limited to bar chart races, but also buddle charts and line graphs, which astonished me. Moreover I learned that the creator was only 19 when these masterpieces were published (Was gonna say how many years I was older than him but that would spoil my own age so yeah)!</p>
		<p>In 2019, a channel named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkWbqlDAyJh2n8DN5X6NZyg" target="_blank" title="Click to see Data is Beautiful's YouTube Channel">Data is Beautiful</a> (which unfortunately stopped uploading videos) came out of nowhere and surpassed most other data visualization channels at that time. It is also that moment that I learned that these bar chart race videos are made in <a href="https://flourish.studio/2019/03/21/bar-chart-race/" target="_blank" title="Click to see Flourish's blog post on How to Make a Bar Chart Race">Flourish Studio</a>, a free data visualization tool online. However, that is different from what I had saw lasy year by WawamuStats.</p>
		<p>This year, one guy introduced a platform called <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/" target="_blank" title="Bilibili official website (Prepare your translates because it is Chinese only)">Bilibili</a>, a Chinese video platform with bullet chats, to explore whether these catagories of videos exist, and I wasn't surprised to find these UPs (In bilibili, channel owners are called "UP"s.) having uploaded these videos. When I watched those videos, I almost immediately recognized the style of the bar chart race from 2018. One of the most amazing one is someone called <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/1850091" target="_blank" title="Click to see Jannchie's Bilibili profile">Jannchie</a>, because when I went to <a href="https://github.com/Jannchie/Historical-ranking-data-visualization-based-on-d3.js" target="_blank" title="Click to see the Bar CHart Race tool made by Jannchie">his GitHub page</a> , I was very shocked to find out that these bar chart race codes were written and published by him!</p>
		<p>And that's how I got huge inspiration to produce such things.</p>
	</section>
	<button class="accordion" onclick="toggleAcc()">Do you play any games?</button>
	<section class="accordion-txt">
		<p>Yes, of course! I mainly play Tap Titans 2 because I like incremental games. Sometimes I also play Minecraft, one of the most popular games in the world.</p>
